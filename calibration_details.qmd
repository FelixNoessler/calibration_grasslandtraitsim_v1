We use multiobjective optimization to calibrate the parameters. The objectives are:

- cut aboveground biomass
- community weighted mean trais (specific leaf area, maximum height, )

We use NSGA-II: Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm @Deb2002 as implemented in Metaheuristics.jl @metaheuristics2022.

We weight the objectives 50 % to aboveground biomass and 50 % distributed equally among the community weighted mean traits.

The calibration was done using the following script:

```julia
{{< include scripts/calibration/calibration.jl >}}
